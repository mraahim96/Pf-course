Main Problems Faced in Assignment 2
In completing Assignment 2, I encountered several challenges. Firstly, understanding the requirements and specifications of the assignment proved to be complex, particularly when it came to interpreting the problem statements. Additionally, I faced difficulties with the implementation of certain algorithms, as I had to familiarize myself with new concepts that were not covered in detail during our lectures like string library and built in functions.
