*Main Problems Faced in Assignment 3:*<br>
In completing Assignment 2, I encountered several challenges. Firstly, understanding the requirements and specifications of the assignment proved to be complex, particularly when it came to interpreting the problem statements. Additionally, I faced difficulties with the implementation of certain algorithms, as I had to familiarize myself with new concepts that were not covered in detail such as dynamic memory allocation,though preparing myself for the final exams of both lab mid and theory this assignment proved to be very useful;by making me face challenging problems it made sure I was ready for the final exams.
